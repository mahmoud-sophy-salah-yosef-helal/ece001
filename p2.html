        <td>Searching the net with Google, you can find everything you want. You can also do shopping using Internet. Of course it has no sense to buying a roll, but if you need something inaccessible, you will be able to buy it in Internet shop. You need only to select what you want, fill in some forms and click ok. In a few days you will get what you have ordered directly to your home, without going anywhere. You can pay with your credit card, pay postman when you get the package, or transfer money from your bank account. Nowadays almost every bigger bank offers transferring money with Internet. It is faster than going to the bank and filling blankets. Transferring money in traditional way takes about a day; using Internet you can do this in few seconds even in Saturday and Sunday evenings. What’s more internet banks give you insurance against unauthorized transaction. Some people think that their money can be easily stolen by hackers. It isn’t true because the easiest way to steal your money from internet bank is breaking to your house and stealing you card of codes. Internet banks have very good protections witch make them practically unbreakable.
Next advantage of internet is email. Internet mails get in a few seconds in their destinations. It is very important when you want to send something for example to Australia. Of course you can send not only texts. You can email whatever you want, movies, photos, songs, computer programs etc. Costs are very important advantage of emails. Sending an email is much cheaper than phoning, or sending normal letters.
Beside a lot of advantages, Internet has some disadvantages too. First of disadvantages is that people who spend too much time sitting in the front of computer can easily get ill. Radiation emitted by computer’s screen is harmful to eyes. People who spend too much time at their homes (because they needn’t go anywhere, they can do everything using Internet) are getting weaker. Sitting a for long time is also harmful to the spine. 
Second disadvantage is that Internet can by addictive. Some people just can’t live without it. They have no real friends and when Internet is down they are getting furious. Internet has some opponents but more and more people treats Internet like telephone, or radio.

        <td>On the other side of the coin if we discuss its disadvantages in brief then following are some common:
A Waste of Time:
Most people argue that spending much time in using internet is bad which leads to obesity in young generation. In a contemporary world people also say that internet is not necessary for life and life would be easier without it.
Not Safe Place for Children:
If children are allowed to use internet then parent become worry if they are spending much time on internet. Pornography and unethical communities are available. So one can say that internet is not a safe place for children because there are different tools available who can bypass ‘parental protection’. Also children who use internet are becoming addicted to it which is again very dangerous.
Money Frauds:
With the introduction of online business, virtual shops and credit card usage; now it becomes very easy to buy things without going into market. Beside legitimate sites there are some other Social Media Advertising sites which make frauds of money, these sites tries to get your personal information, credit card details and even pin code. Once they get this information you can easily become victim of money frauds.
